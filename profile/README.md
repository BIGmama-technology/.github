# About Us ‚ú®

BIGmama is a startup from Algeria üá©üáø. We're on a mission to democratize building with AI. ü§ñ

# What we do 

We are an AI studio. We find exeptional experts in any field, we scope their problems, we translate and hybridize their expertise with AI models, and we keep delivering prototypes and iterating over them until we solve the problem.

# Our mission

We are on a mission to prove to ourselves "Africans" and to the rest of the world that we can build world class technology by Africans in Africa. üåç

# How we work üèé 

- Fully in-person in our Algiers office, with a superb view to the "baie d'alger".
- You will work closly with our AI and Software engineers, who will define clear tasks for the team.
- We embrace a Git workflow for all teams : management, HR, design, AI, and software.
- Sometimes we have experts, politicians and celebrities come have coffee with us. (Maybe its time to launch BIGmama podcast ü§î)
